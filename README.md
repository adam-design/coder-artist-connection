## Meet my Teammate

[View online here](http://cac.cloud.vgmoose.com)

Meet my Teammate is an application that helps coders/artists find other coders/artists who are interested in the same project.

The goal of the project aims to solve two problems: 

1. Artists tend to work in jobs that they are less passionate but more lucrative
2. Coders need artists to design/create art for their apps/websites

By pairing artists and coders who are interested in similar projects, the artists are able to get their foot in the door for their passion and possibly start getting paid for their work, and developers are able to made their work more beautiful and usable.
